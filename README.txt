Welcome to Dungeon Crawler!

The objective of the game is simple: You are a knight stuck inside of a dungeon and you need to explore the different items and find your way out.

In order to move, use the arrow keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). Within the dungeon, you will find different kinds of potions that increase your score, as well as bombs that can have you lose the game.
Also, make sure to look for the key, as it will unlock the door that lets you out. Once obtaining the key, go up to the door and press "A" and enter through it to win!

You can also use SELECT to exit the game at any point and reset to play again.
